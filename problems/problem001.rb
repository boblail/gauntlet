      # This one's not math, I swear!

      # Your job is to create a calculator which evaluates expressions
      # in postfix notation, sometimes called reverse Polish notation.

      # For example, the expression
      # 
      #     5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 -
      #
      # is equivalent to
      #
      #     5 + ((1 + 2) * 4) - 3
      #
      # and evaluates to 14.

      # Note for simplicity's sake you can assume there are always spaces
      # between numbers and operations.
      # e.g. `1 3 +` is valid but `1 3+` is not.
